Have you completed your basic training?<br>
I see that you're really excited about joining the ranks of Orc Lancers.<br>
First of all, let me tell you about the <font color="LEVEL">Blazing Beast</font> skill. You can use it if you have <font color="LEVEL">500 or more Beast Points (BP)</font>. Activating the skill costs <font color="LEVEL">100 BP</font>.<br>
The effect is active while you have BP.<br>
All Orc Lancers must know it, so don't forget.<br>
