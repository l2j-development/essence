<html><body>First Vanguard Rider Sabitus:<br>
I bear the title of the First Vanguard Rider. My duty is to show young Orcs the new path of Orc Lancers.<br>
I'd be happy to teach you something, but you are not Orc Lancer, so I have nothing to say to you.<br>
Why don't you go to Flame Guardian Vulkus? I'm sure he'll be happy to help you.
