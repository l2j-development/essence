You can open your <font color="LEVEL">skill UI</font> by pressing <font color="LEVEL">Alt+K</font>.<br>
The skills you've already learned can be dragged to the <font color="LEVEL">shortcut panel</font> or the <font color="LEVEL">auto-use slots</font>. The latter lets you use them while<font color="LEVEL">auto-hunting</font>.<br>
And now why don't you try putting this information into practice? Go to <font color="LEVEL">the northern part of the Immortal Plateau</font> and kill 30 monsters. There you will encounter <font color="LEVEL">Maraku Werewolf Chieftains, Evil Eye Patrols, Kasha Spiders and Kasha Blade Spiders</font>.<br>
And that concludes the last of my lessons. After dealing with monsters, go to <font color="LEVEL">Gantaki Zu Urutu</font><br>
He has traveled around the world for a long time and has accomplished many glorious feats to the glory of all Orcs. I think he has something useful to tell you.<br>
